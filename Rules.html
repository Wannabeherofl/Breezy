                <h1><strong>BreezyRP RULES AND REGULATIONS</strong></h1>
                <hr>
                <div><br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>
BreezyRP and its owners seek to provide an excellent FiveM GTA RP experience, while allowing players to maintain creativity by maintaining a “mostly-serious RP” standpoint, which also allows for content creators to make their best content on the server. These rules and regulations are meant to maintain the previously mentioned standpoint.
<br><br><strong>Expectations</strong><br><br>

Players who are accepted to BreezyRP are expected to maintain compliance with these rules and regulations at all times while also doing their best to provide an excellent RP experience with themselves as well as others in the server. Players are expected to report issues to Staff using the proper mediums and guidelines, while following the proper Chain of Command.

<br><br><strong>Application Process</strong><br><br>
Applicants must submit an application via the AppyBot in the BreezyRP Main Discord (discord.gg/breezy) within the “#civilian-application” channel and wait for their application to either be accepted or denied by Civilian Administrators. DMing or harassing ANYONE about your app will result in instant denial, and you will have to apply again.
Once your application is accepted, you will be given the “Needs Interview (Civ)” role. Civilian Interviewers will announce when they’re hosting interviews in the #civ-interviewee-chat channel. DMing or harassing ANYONE about your interview will result in removal and you will have to apply again.
If you are fully accepted, you will then be whitelisted to play in BreezyRP!

3.44.1 - Overall Quality of Roleplay Clarification (AKA “ShitRP”): If a staff member or member of Civ Command deduces from their observation or from civilian reports that your quality of roleplay is extremely low, you may be unwhitelisted from the server. Severe cases will result in bans. This rule is subject to the discretion of Civilian Command and Staff members. Examples include but are not limited to: making characters whose only goal is to “rob everyone” or “kill all cops.” This rule also applies to people who approach BreezyRP with a “win” mentality. This is a RP server – not everything has to have a favorable outcome for you. (Added 2/1/2023)

Criminal Activity Limitations and Group Limits
You are limited to 6 in a group when taking part in criminal activities of any kind.
Life for a life: If some of your (up to 6) members are arrested, you are able to take hostages to negotiate for your friend's freedom. Only up to 6 (INCLUDING CAPTURED FRIENDS) are allowed to participate. (This is a continuation of an ongoing scene) This is NOT a shootout, it is to be a well executed plan to free your friends. This must happen BEFORE the police reach a police station.
If a second team is formed they may only participate if a prison transport is approved. (A staff member must be present to oversee)
Rooftops: Only rooftops that are accessible by foot are permitted to be used during shootouts. The only exception to this is when you are defending your gang's home base.
Externals: During a robbery you MAY have externals but they must be counted in the number of individuals allowed in the crime. These externals do not need to be announced but their goal is to help escape. IF you open fire you must either warn you’re going to shoot or pop some warning shots at the hood of the cop car or ground around the cops.
Hostages: You may take hostages that you know. You MAY NOT have hostages be a part of the crime taking place. Once they are secured by police they should leave the scene unless directed otherwise. 
MRPD is a green zone. You may only negotiate for the release of your friend in the following examples: 
Before reaching MRPD while in the active scene 
During a prison transport 
During a prison break 
At Pillbox or MRPD (green zones) you are not to initiate a release, you must let police play out their scene. 
Police are still within their rights to enforce the law in these zones.
Weapons should be a last resort. We expect you to RP it out and only use a weapon if you feel there is no other choice. You should always be aiming to escape and lose as few lives as possible.
You may not camp Police Stations.
You must value the lives of the transported prisoners.

You are not allowed to rob LEO purely for the intent of gaining their equipment.
Police should be feared/respected. (Just because our police force is limited does not mean you should try to kill them all) We do not want to see constant shootouts between criminals and PD. 
LEO issued weapons include: Pistol, Taser, Carbine Rifle, Shotgun, Baton, Handcuffs
You MAY only take pd issued consumables such as bandages, ammo, armor. Exceptions can be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Owners or Management. Asking for permission to do this will result in instant denial and possible punishment.
Limitations on Motorcycles as Getaway Vehicles
Motorcycles are only to be used as a primary vehicle for getaway only during minor crimes. 
Motorcycles can only be used as a secondary vehicle for major crimes (Banks/Jewelry). A secondary vehicle is a vehicle setup previous to the crime that must be a reasonable distance from the crime. 
Robbing
You may NOT kill the person you are robbing if they are compliant. You may rob people but you need to initiate first. You may only fire your weapon if:
The person does not comply with demands (must give reasonable amount of time to comply)
They attempt to pull out their own weapon or radio for help.
You may only take cash that is currently on their person.
No bank cards, pin numbers, or forced bank transactions will be permitted
You may NOT rob someone while they are in a menu ie: clothing store/player market
Strongarming certain businesses: You may NOT strongarm or force someone of the real estate or car dealership businesses to change prices with threats or acts of violence.
Pocket-wiping: You must leave the person you are robbing with a phone.
Body-camping: You may not hold on to a body for more than 5 minutes past the end of the scene. Once you leave the body, you must make sure the individuals are accessible by emergency services. 
You may NOT steal someone's car and downgrade it.

Value of Life Guidelines
Not realistically fearing for your life when you are threatened with weapons or severe harm.
Antagonizing gangs or armed individuals for no character reason is not allowed.
Players should not be inserting themselves into ongoing situations or shootouts. 
If you are not involved in, but find yourself close to, a dangerous situation you must try to flee and find a safe location.
If you are outnumbered you MUST fear for your life. 
If you have a gun drawn on you and you did not already have a gun out you must fear for your life.

Initiation
Before initiating on another player/group, you must have a valid roleplay reason for initiating. There is no textbook definition for valid initiation, use common sense when considering initiation. 
Valid: Initiating on someone because earlier this person robbed and shot your friend.
Invalid: Initiating on someone for the sole intent on killing them and taking their stuff.   
In order for initiation to be valid, you must make physical verbal contact with the player that conveys your intentions.
Valid: “I am sick of you talking shit about my gang, put your hands up or I will shoot you” 
Invalid: Screaming “Stop or die, stop or die” at a moving vehicle. 
The use of firearms is the last resort in a confrontation and must be justified with a valid reason in the RP scenario.
You must give a reasonable amount of time for someone to comply with your demands. You cannot shoot someone seconds after initiating for moving too slow. 
You may not shoot a compliant hostage.
Initiating from a vehicle is allowed, but must be used within realistic means. You can try to initiate from a stopped or slowly moving vehicle. You can not initiate from a speeding vehicle, you would not be able to hear someone screaming out of the window of a fast moving car.  

Jail Rules
You may NOT be broken out of jail by means of aircrafts or cars jumping over gates
If you need to leave the city (or there is a tsunami) while in prison, you MUST return to your last location on return to the city and finish out your sentence.

Quality of Roleplay Clarifications
Stay in character at all times. In the event there’s an issue, completely role-play out the scenario and player report if needed. Do not break character / inform the player they are breaking a rule in-game.
If a gang catches you wearing their gang named clothing and they tell you to remove it, failure to do so will give that specific gang authorization to kill you (this is one way initiation), bypassing the initiation cooldown rules. Once they kill you and forcefully remove the specific piece that represents them from your body, you MUST comply or be subjected to a FAIL-RP punishment.
Gang Named clothes - Chains, Vests, Flags, Impersonation
You are not allowed to leave someone in cuffs after a situation is over. 
You are not allowed to have multiple characters (from the same player) in one gang/group). Try to avoid creating multiple characters involved in the same story/scenarios that could use the same information to push their goals.
You may NOT make additional characters in order to gain funds. This will result in a permanent ban.
If the police bring you to the Government Center in order to obtain your identification you must follow their instructions.
You are not allowed to block vehicle spawns
You cannot log off while in combat/RP situations
When restraining/cuffing someone, you must be behind them and they must be immobile. (tazed, tackled, surrendering, or hands up) (Pending review)
When being pulled over by police you must have a reason for evading.
Evading police for the intent of getting into a chase is not allowed
Starting a  chase with the police without verbal contact (out of their vehicle) does not count as valid initiation
Valid: An officer asks you to step out of your vehicle and you have illegal items so you need to avoid being searched
Valid: You have a warrant for your arrest
Invalid: You do not want to stop/want a chase
Invalid You hate/are scared of police
Once downed on your side you are still conscious and may speak or use comms (still must fear for your life). 
When you are on your back (double-tapped/bled out) you are unconscious and must RP such. No talking/comms.
Bodycam is only to be used IC by PD/EMS unless you are wearing a physical body camera. If you are wearing a physical body camera remember there is a possibility that PD can issue a subpoena for the footage if a judge approves.
PD is always running bodycam, to dispose of bodycam footage you can /me *smashes bodycam* and otherwise destroy dashcam on PD vehicles. PD can retrieve footage from downed officers and vehicles on scene up until the officer is healed and leaves the hospital. Unless it is destroyed. 


Cop baiting is NOT allowed (attracting police attention with the intent of starting a chase or to otherwise escalate a situation)
Ex: Pulling up to a cop and screaming PDK or calling them pigs and peeling off to initiate a chase
Ex: Intentionally ramming police
After a scene has ended you must give the police 5 minutes to regain visuals/reengage before fleeing into your apartment/MLO/house to change your clothing or store items.
Third-Partying: Involving yourself in a scene you were not originally a part of. 
Valid: Your friends radio for help before the scene ends and you go to assist them (remember weapons should always be your last option)
Valid: You radio your friends during an active engagement with weapons 
Invalid: Robbing a body that you did not kill
Invalid: Inserting yourself into a traffic stop with police.



New Life Rules
What you can and can not do after your death
When downed (on your side) upon revival you can remember the lead up to your death. 
When downed and double tapped (on your back) and revived, you forget the events that led up to your death and 15 minutes prior to that, you cannot use bodycam to remember the situation.
EMS can stabilize injured individuals (anyone not put on their back prior to arrival at scene/treatment from the medical professional begins
Once stabilized, you are allowed to talk and remember what happened even if you enter a bleed out state (get on your back) enroute to Pillbox.
In the event of a police shootout if all officers are downed there can be no bodycam. If at least 1 officer is still alive they may retrieve bodycam from the downed officers only if the alive officer remembers to take it off their body before exiting Pillbox. Take advantage of /me. (ie. /me smashes bodycam)
When you bleed out and hit the respawn button, you forget the events that lead up to your death along with the previous hour [You still remember friends/gangs/phone contacts etc], you cannot use bodycam to “remember” the situation
After being downed (on side) you must wait at least 15 minutes before returning to an active scene. You can only return if your friends/gang members are still actively involved. You may NOT return to the scene if you were on your back.
When left dead from a scene you must first contact EMS (/311) then after 10 mins you may contact police (/911) and lastly you must either press E to respawn or F8 and not return to the city for at least 30 mins. You may NOT contact a staff member for a /revive or use 3rd party communication to help someone find your body.


EMS/Medic Rules
EMS characters can NOT be in a gang
EMS characters may NOT commit crimes
EMS characters CAN be robbed/kidnapped/killed while on duty – but only if the RP scene ABSOLUTELY calls for it and should be used as a LAST RESORT.
EMS have full custody. You may not rob someone / take hostage if EMS has custody of them. 
Medics CAN NOT revive in a firefight.
EMS vehicles are for EMS only, Report stolen EMS vehicles.
Only EMS may wear EMS gear.
EMS can not give out information such as blips

Power/Meta Gaming
Using means not actually in-game to gain an advantage
Avoiding the use of the “Put in vehicle” command. (escorting/carrying/thing people while in vehicles)
You may only carry a downed person if there is an extra vehicle seat available in a 2 seater. “/me puts in passenger seat/on bike of back”
Metagaming is purposely using or relaying information that your character did not learn in-game (Twitch Chats and Discord Channels included) to shape in-game roleplay.
Powergaming - When a player claims that an action they have taken against another player character has been successful without allowing the other player character to respond in accordance with their character. This is usually done without the other character’s permission or prior knowledge.
Making a bomb threat to a building without a bomb mechanic in game. 
The use of emotes to gain advantage or overcome obstacles. (Ex Emoting through a door)
Voice recognition: Some people have more than 1 character. You must have at least 1 additional identifier before using someone's voice to “know” them.
You may not engage in a robbery 30 mins before or 20 mins after a restart.
This is not an exhaustive list of examples. You can be punished for meta-gaming/powergaming if you are found to be doing so.


Notes on Ticket-Making:
We will NOT reveal the punishment of another player to you, do not ask. That is only for staff and the other player to know.
Sharing things you learn in a report will result in your own punishment.
Showing staff disrespect may result in the closure of your ticket and/or punishment
Staff are players as well, please keep this in mind. We will get to your tickets as quickly as possible but you must be patient. Do NOT tag staff in tickets.
If you cut footage to exclude your own rule breaks you will be punished
If you falsely accuse someone it will result in punishment.
Submitting footage that is too short will result in case dismissal.
If you make a ticket, the incident in question can be no longer than 1 day old, this is to stop people compiling clips etc instead of reporting rule breaks as they happen. 2. Any clip you are showing as proof must be MINIMUM 2 minutes long or risk your ticket being dismissed on the spot, this is to stop people uploading shortened, cropped evidence which doesn't show the whole picture.



Gang Rules (To be Revised)

You may not take over and tax legal jobs. You must give civilians a chance to also live in the city.
For the time being gangs will be limited to 20 members, this includes prospects/hangarounds but not pickers/other “workers”.

Gang War
For a gang war to be initiated, a gang war ticket must be made via discord for a member of Management to review and decide to approve/deny the war.

Note: For clarification, you may still initiate on other gangs without a gang war being active but you are limited to 6 people. 
If you choose to attack another gang that is in excess of 6 that is at your own risk.
(Ex: MLO’s)
